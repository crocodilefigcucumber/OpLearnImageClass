# Experiments on FMNIST for ETHZ Semester Paper

Original Setup has been taken from [here](https://github.com/samirak98/FourierImaging), [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01227), and slight modifications (incl. FNO/CNO implementation) of the codebase have been performed.
For CNO implementation refer to [this repo](https://github.com/camlab-ethz/ConvolutionalNeuralOperator), ViTs have been fine-tuned using code from [this repo](https://github.com/).

To reproduce, simply run the (commented-out) parts of the install script.
